<h1><center>Skyline High School<br>Alumni Soccer Games</center></h1>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  The day after Thanksgiving each year,
  alumni from the boys soccer team at
  <a href="https://skyline.ousd.org">Skyline High School</a>
  (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=12250+Skyline+Blvd,+Oakland+CA">map</a>)
  in Oakland, California
  meet to play a soccer game.
  Traditionally the alumni played against the current varsity team,
  but the varsity team has not attended recently,
  so nowadays the alumni scrimmage amongst themselves.
  These games have been played since 1973:
  <blockquote>
    The alumni games officially started on Friday, November 23, 1973,
    which was my first alumni game,
    having graduated in June of that year.
    As I recall,
    a number of my graduated mates came back to play,
    including Gary Frazier,
    Mike Conley,
    Brian Sinnott,
    Omar Suer
    and a few others that I can't remember (that was a long time ago!).
    I believe we had to play with several of the varsity players
    out of a group that included Don Craig, Herb Schmidt, Eric Rudney, et. al.
    <br>
    <br>
    Leland Heiner
    <br>
    Class of 1973
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The games were held at
  <a href="https://www.merritt.edu">Merritt College</a>
  (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=12500+Campus+Dr,+Oakland+CA">map</a>)
  near Skyline every year since I became involved (starting in 1979),
  but in 2006 we decided to try a different location
  because we had been kicked off Merritt in recent years
  by campus security for not having a paid permit,
  which would cost at least $180.
</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>
  Here are the numbers of participants since I began keeping track in 1999.
  An entry in the Alumni column shown as M+N
  means M alumni showed up
  and N non-alumni (parents, siblings, children, or friends) also played.

<h2>The 2006 Game</h2>

  We played at
  <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=3883+Aliso+Ave,+Oakland+CA">Redwood Heights Park</a>.
  Although we weren't bothered by security people here,
  the field was in poor condition.

<h2>The 2010 Game #2</h2>
<p>
  Thanks to tireless organizing efforts from Patrick Riley,
  the current varsity team was allowed to scrimmage against the alumni
  at 3:30pm on Friday, December 10, 2010
  on Skyline's field.
</p>
<p>
  Skyline's football/soccer field was converted
  from grass into FieldTurf in 2003.
  This was the first time I had seen the new field.
  Although I generally think grass is better than artificial surfaces,
  I like Skyline's new field because the old grass field
  was usually muddy and full of pot holes.
</p>
<p>
  The weather was overcast and heavy fog and mist
  descended onto the field during the game,
  but this cool weather was perfect for playing.
</p>
<p>
  The alumni didn't find out about the game until the night before,
  so it was difficult for people to rearrange their schedules to play.
  We scrounged together 11 players to begin the game,
  including 3 of the coach's children.
  More alumni arrived as time went on.
  I think we ended up with 13 players and 2 observers,
  but I don't think all of the players on the alumni team were alumni.
</p>
<p>
  The game was scoreless for about 20 minutes,
  then the varsity team scored about 4 goals before halftime.
  The coach asked us to use all of our players in the second half,
  to put more pressure on the varsity team.
  Playing numbers up helped the alumni.
  The varsity team didn't score many goals in the second half,
  and the alumni had some good scoring chances but didn't finish any.
</p>
<p>
  Although the varsity team won about 5-0,
  I didn't feel embarrassed to be playing against them
  because I thought we provided a reasonable challenge for them.
  I was impressed by the ball skills and speed
  of several of the varsity players,
  and overall the varsity team played well together
  and performed some nice combination play,
  but several of the alumni players appeared capable of matching up well
  against the varsity players.
</p>
<p>
  After the game,
  the coach appeared pleased because it allowed him to evaluate players
  in a realistic game setting
  before they begin their league season.
  He expressed interest in continuing this resurrected connection
  with the alumni,
  so hopefully we will be able to schedule another event with the varsity team
  next year.
</p>
<h2>The 2011 Game</h2>
<p>
  We played at
  <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Caldecott+Field,+Broadway,+Oakland,+CA">Caldecott Field</a>.
  The weather was nice.
  The field was soggy.
  We had alumni from 4 decades playing:
  1970s,
  1980s,
  1990s,
  and 2000s.

<h2>The 2012 Game</h2>
<p>
  We played at
  <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Caldecott+Field,+Broadway,+Oakland,+CA">Caldecott Field</a>.
  The weather was nice.
  We had alumni from 3 decades playing:
  1970s,
  1980s,
  and 1990s.
  We also had 3 generations playing:
  a father,
  us,
  and a son.
  A highlight this year was an appearance by
  Leland Heiner (Class of 1973, one of the original participants),
  who dropped by to bring beer and say hi.
  He says he will bring his gear and play next year!
